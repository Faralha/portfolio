## Muhammad Zufar Al Hafidz
Is my formal Name. I began my programming journey back in 2021, creating my own Discord Bot using Youtube Tutorials. Since then, countless  projects have been made, from basic landing page to full-stack website (mainly Nuxt + NestJS).

I am a self-taught programmer, until i began my Compsci degree at ITS, Surabaya. My first (frontend) framework interest was Nuxt + Vue, but nowadays i'm also capable of using Next + React too.

Currently as stated before, i'm an Undergraduate Informatics Engineering Student at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS) Surabaya, batch 2023. On free time, i usually create mini projects such as imagebox for my manga website. Read more about my projects on the [Projects Page](/projects).

My hobby is to procasinate, watching [Anime](https://myanimelist.net/profile/Faralha) (not anymore), and create mini projects.
