## Overview
Bubble Cleaner for manga using the YOLOv11-segmented model, optimized for faster and lighter inference while maintaining high detection accuracy. A GPU isn't needed (Just CPU is enough!).

The main inspiration was from [Not Another Bubble Cleaner](https://github.com/LiteralGenie/NotAnotherBubbleCleaner). But the inference was too slow and heavy, as it uses Mask-RCNN, a quite outdated technology. We want an accurate detection, but we also want it fast. Thus we uses YOLOv11-segmented. It is quick, light, and (mostly) accurate.

This project started as a final assignment for my Machine Learning course. While brainstorming, i was thinking, "Why dont we just make a tool to help clean manga bubbles?" cause i myself is a Scanlator and i know how tedious bubble cleaning can be. So, here we are.

This is a team project consists of me, [Razky](https://github.com/yuusha25), and Praja.

## How It Works (oversimplified)
1. It first detects a bubble using YOLOv11-segmented model.
2. Then, it creates a mask from the detected bubble and applies inpainting using OpenCV to remove the bubble.
3. Finally, it saves the cleaned image to the output folder.

## What's Next?
- Improve detection accuracy
- Custom mask offset
- A GUI interface...?
