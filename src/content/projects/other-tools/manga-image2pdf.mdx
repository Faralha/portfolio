## Overview
Quick manga to pdf converter. It basically create pdf based on 'Volume' Folder.

It came with two options: Organized (sorted per Volume), or unorganized. For the unorganized you'll need to define how much chapter per volume will have.

Written in Python 3.11.2, Compiled with pyinstaller.

## Features
- Bulk PDF per folder
- Sorted and Unsorted mode/options
- Precompiled binary

## Stories Behind
While there is a lot image2pdf tools out there, you still to either manually select images, which is a hassle for converting 30+ chapters manga.

So then i made this simple tool.

It is also a vibe-coded project. It works as intended.
