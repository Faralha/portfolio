## Overview
A simple ngrok ip notifier to Discord.js with other features.

## Stories Behind
So i was self hosting this minecraft server at home using ngrok as port forwarded. But everytime the ngrok restarted, the link also changed. So i was thinking, "Why dont i make discord bot out of this?"

## Features
- Notify when ngrok starts/restarts with new link
- Command to get current ngrok link
- Command to get server status (online players, max players, etc)

## Tech Stack
- **Discord Bot**: Discord.js
- **ngrok API**
