## Overview
A Fullstack manga reading website, full with features. A Successor to [alterkai-website](https://github.com/Alterkai/alterkai-website), hence why it's called Alterkai v2 (Codename: Monolithic). Powered by Nuxt 3, PostgreSQL, and Redis.

I used monolithic because i don't want to be bothered with deploying multiple services that time. I also want to try Nuxt 3's new server engine (Nitro) that said to be able to handle backend logic as well.

> It is great, but i just don't like the file-based routing for backend... The dir, is a mess...

## Features
- User Authentication using JWT token 
- Manga, Chapters, Genres, Bookmarks Management (CRUD)
- Last read tracking using local storage
- Manga and Chapter view tracking using Redis
- Random Daily Highlights using PostgreSQL's RANDOM (+keys so random stays the same for a day)
- Basic Comments
- CDN using Azure Blob storage

## Stories Behind
After learning "Pembelajaran Web" (Web Development) course, i wanted to create another project based on Nuxt. This time, i (again) wanted to create my long-awaited dream of creating manga reading website. Thus, Alterkai: Monolithic is born.

Alterkai: Monolithic takes a lot of reference to [MangaDex](https://mangadex.org).

This project is marked as Inactive (and scraped), since i have moved to microservice-based project with the same goal named: KomikDex. The newer one will feature much cleaner codebase, docker support, and better architecture.
