## Overview
A BunnyCDN unofficial Web Interface to ease with image hosting (imgBox like). The idea is to directly upload image(s) and get the link tag.

## Features
- Retrieve Folders from BunnyCDN Storage Zone
- Upload Image(s) to selected Folder
- Generate & Copy `<img>` tag for uploaded image(s)

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Express.js
- **BunnyCDN Storage Zone API**

## Stories Behind
As you may know, i have a scanlation website [Alterkai](https://alterkaiscans.my.id). But the image hosting still uses free could-lose-anytime providers that directly gives `<img>` tags. I could just use normal CDN (in this case: BunnyCDN), but they don't provide interface to automatically upload AND generate `<img>` tags directly. So then i made this App. 

It was vibe-coded though, and the code itself is quite ~sh*t~ i must admit.

> I mean, why did i make such simple job using Express.js??? 🤣
