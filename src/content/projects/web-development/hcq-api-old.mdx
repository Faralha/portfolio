## Overview
It's a REST API backend for HCQ first LMS attempt. Built using raw Express.js and MySQL (without ORM). It is poorly designed and coded (xd)

## Stories Behind
After my first semester at CompSci has ended (break period!), i was very excited of Databases (SQL). Weird, huh? But yeah, that particular course (Basic Database) is what brings me to develop my own backend using Express.js and MySQL.

It is very poorly designed and coded (as mentioned), without any types and ORM. Just raw SQL queries everywhere (its chaos). It is mentioned that this was from back in 2025, but i started this on 2024, when AI tools are not that advanced yet (you can't put AI directly to read and write code...).

> I still remember how hell it is to setup passport (express.js auth plugin) since the docs are confusing, and tutorials are not helpful...

This project is later used as a usecase for my "Perancangan Perangkat Lunak" or Software Design course, as it uses many software design patterns such as repository pattern, etc.

IIRC, this was meant for fullstack (using Express.js + EJS) but i switched to Nuxt.js midway...?
