## Overview
A Full Stack Learning Management System using Microservices architecture, and fully integrated with automated CI/CD pipelines using Github Actions and Docker. I'm gonna be honest; i'm using **AI assisted tools** to help develop this one. But i assure you, this is unlike any other ~AI Slop~ vibe-coded applications. I personally design the architecture, applied best practice (modularity, separation of concerns, scalability, CI/CD, etc), and wrote the bootstrapping code myself.

> This project(s) is a proof that AI assisted development can and will be the future, while also using best practices and solid architecture as human developers. AI is merely a tool to boost productivity. If the application turns out bad, welp, it's the Developer's fault 🤣.

I learnt a lot from this projects; how to design a system from zero, how to properly deploy a javascript applications to a server, how to setup CI/CD pipelines, and many more...

Unfortunately, this project is not yet needed by the Organizations. If by the time reading this and the demo site is down, you know why :).

## Features
- Full Authentication System with Role-Based Access Control (Admin, Teachers, Students)
- Teacher Registration using magic link via email
- Classroom Management (Semesters, Course, Class, Enrollments)
- Attendance System using Code
- Tuition and Salary Management
- Automatic Report Generation (PDF) server-side

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Nuxt.js 4 + Nuxt UI + TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: NestJS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Message Queue**: BullMQ + Redis

## Architecture and Why
- **Docker**: More secure, easier to maintain, zero downtime deployment
- *Microservices*: Separation of concerns, easier to scale and deploy
- **Event-driven Message Queue**: Decoupled services, better performance for tasks like report generation

## CI/CD pipelines
- Automated testing (lint, unit, e2e) on pre-commit and pull requests
- Automated Docker image build on push to main branch
- Automated deployment to production server using Docker Compose
