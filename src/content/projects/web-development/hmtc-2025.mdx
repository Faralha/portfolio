## Overview
My very first real-world real-organization project: HMTC (Himpunan Mahasiswa Teknik Computer-Informatika) Kabinet Suar Peradaban 2025. I was a regular frontend staff there, but was given (quite) rough tasks since the beginning, such as refactoring the whole codebase, optimizing performance, and setting up a bundler.

> It is also a very clean codebase... I learnt a lot such as proper component structuring, composables, layout, state management, and many more...

Basically the whole turning point of my website development skills starts from here. Thanks, HMTC 2025!

## What I Did
- Refactored the whole codebase to use Kabinet Suar Peradaban
- Improved performance by reducing image sizes (from MBs to KBs!) and reduced font size (.otf to .woff2)
- Purge unused assets
- Set up bundler analyzer
- Modal Dialog component
and many more...

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js v15
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Language**: TypeScript

I still work in here, since i continued at HMTC for another year...

The site loading speed is pretty slow despite the optimizations (like 200kb images took 2s to load?). There's a lot of problems on the deployment side, and i'm currently working on fixing it (and moving it to docker-based deployment).

I will (probably) update the migration and updates on my blog.
