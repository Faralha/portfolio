## Overview
A business landing page for Tropica Sweets, a palm-natural sugar exporter based in Indonesia. My friend asked me to create a simple but business-like landing page for his company, and so i made this using Nuxt.js and Bootstrap CSS.

> This project is also my very first client project! 🎉 (yes, paid)

I was still quite new to web development back then. I even still uses Bootstrap CSS 🤣. But still, most of the works (UI/UX design, Frontend) was created manually by myself. Yes, it was the era when AI tools (such as copilot) isn't common yet. I believe i only use it for the carousel sections...

## Techstack
- **Frontend**: Nuxt.js 3 + Bootstrap CSS
- **Hosting**: Vercel

There's really not much to talk about this...
